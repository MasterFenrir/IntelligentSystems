function [ finalPrototypes ] = vectorQuantization( dataset, k, n, mu, tMax, prototypeStrat )
%VECTORQUANTIZATION Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here

% Initialize the prototypes by selecting random data points
% From 1 to tMax:
%   Shuffle data
%   for each datapoint, compare to prototypes
%   Protype that is closest gets updated by n
%   Plot datapoints
%   Evaluate the quantization error Hvq
% Plot the quantization error as a function of t
